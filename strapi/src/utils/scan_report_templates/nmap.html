        <p class="tool_description">Network Mapper stands as a
            versatile and essential network
            scanning tool designed to comprehensively investigate
            and
            evaluate the security posture of networked systems. By
            meticulously probing the open ports, services, and
            operating
            systems of networked devices, Nmap aids in identifying
            potential entry points that malicious actors could
            exploit.
